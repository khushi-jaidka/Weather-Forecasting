Project Description :-
This Weather Forecasting project is a front-end static web page developed using only HTML and CSS. It features a visually appealing layout designed to represent a typical weather application. The interface includes placeholders for current temperature, weather conditions, location, and date. As no JavaScript or backend integration is used, the project does not provide real-time data and serves primarily as a design prototype.It is ideal for demonstrating UI/UX design concepts and can be extended in the future with interactive features and live data.
